It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great place out of a big number of other places in New Zealand.\n\nI been planning to move to New Zealand and will be great if I have lots of information about which places have the facilities that best fit my family lifestyle. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n\nThis Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people (like me) migrating to New Zealand to search the best fitted place as a comparative analysis between populated places. The features include median housing price and the most common facilities around in that place.\n\nIt will help people to get awareness of the area and place before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Foursquare API</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This project will use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source because it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Work Flow</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined.
